# bookbot


BookBot is my first project. It will take any ".txt" file and give you:

- Total number of words
- How many number of each letter/symbol/character there are

To use this, you must install and use on a Linux terminal. Was made to be used with Ubuntu WLS in mind.
Python 3 is necesary as well.

========================================

To call the program, first make sure to be in the same directory as "main.py". Then write:

python3 main.py <path_to_book>

examples of use:

 - python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
 - python3 main.py ~/benjamin/documents/books/mobydick.txt
 - etc...
